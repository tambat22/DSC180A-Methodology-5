### Capstone: [Distributed Systems for Financial and Behavioral Data](https://rodalbuyeh.github.io/capstone-distributed-domain/)
* Professor: Rod Albuyeh
* Section: A15

### Questions
1. **What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**
    - The most interesting topic covered in my domain is the idea that I am able to significantly improve the overall runtime of my pipeline by optimizing the code to run on distributed cores. Additionally, I find it interesting that models such as XGBoost, which are already distributed by default, are able to be so effective without much tweaking.

2. **Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**
    - One potential investigation that I would like to pursue in my Quarter 2 Project is to have the code run on distributed clusters on AWS. I would like to see how much the speedup in runtime would be with the increase of compute. I would also like to learn more about AWS and be able to set up simple deployment pipelines.

3. **What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**
    - One potential change I would make to the approach taken in Quarter 2 compared to Quarter 1 is that I would focus more on specific tasks that I can accomplish through the week rather than try to follow general guidelines. For example, this quarter, one of my tasks was adding Dask functionality to the codebase. However, I should have explicitly defined what files I want to start with optimizing with Dask first. This would have made working with my teammates easier as this ambiguity let to some confusion about what files I was working on.

4. **What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**
    - One technique I would be interested in using my project are more EDA research to determine what features may not be necessary for training. Another technique I would like to try is researching if distributed hyperparameter tuning utilizing Dask tools would help in model training improvements.
